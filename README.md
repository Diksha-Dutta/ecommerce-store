## Razorpay Payment – Why It Won’t Work Right Now

Razorpay integration has been included with the proper script and setup logic.  
However, **live transactions or even test payments won't work until:**

1. **You sign up and log in** at [Razorpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/signup)
2. **Your business details are verified** (e.g., PAN, GST, Bank info)
3. **Test keys** (`rzp_test_Key`) are retrieved from the dashboard

🔐 Until that’s done, we are going to use **Cash on Delivery (COD)** to simulate the full checkout flow.
